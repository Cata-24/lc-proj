# LCOM Project

This project, developed in Minix3, implements the I/Os drivers timer, keyboard, mouse and video to create a labyrinth based game where the player has to go through 3 levels.
In this game the player navigates through a room filled with enemies, obstacles and collectibles like hearts and stars.
The player can move and interact with the environment to overcome challenges, like killing the monsters, catching the stars and get the key to open the door to the next level, and use speed to go through special walls.
There is also a life system feature that allows the player to catch more lives if they lose one by colliding with monsters or bombs.
